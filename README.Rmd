The goal of `pickler` is to provide [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/) helpers for [`testthat`'s `describe()` and `it()` functions](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/describe.html).

## Installation

You can install the development version of pickler from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mjfrigaard/pickler")
```

```{r}
library(pickler)
```


```{r testthat, eval=TRUE}
if (!require(pak)) {
  install.packages("pak",
    repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org"
  )
}
pak::pkg_install("r-lib/testthat", upgrade = TRUE, ask = FALSE)
library(testthat)
```

## Example

`testthat`'s BDD functions allow for more explicit descriptions of tests: 

```{r}
describe(description = "verify that you implement the right things", code = {
  it(description = "ensure you do the things right", code = {
    expect_true(TRUE)
  })
})
```

`pickler` provides a set of helpers for writing [Gherkin-style](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) features, backgrounds and scenarios which can be placed in `describe()` and `it()`:  

```{r}
describe(
  feature(
    title = "My thing's feature",
    as_a = "user of this thing",
    i_want = "to verify that I implemented the right thing",
    so_that = "I'm sure I did the thing right"
  ), code = {
  it(
    scenario(
        title = "Example of using thing",
        given = "My package is installed and loaded",
        when = "I do something",
        then = "the right thing happens"
      ), code = {
    expect_true(TRUE)
  })
})
```

`pickler` functions can also it can be dropped into the `desc` argument of `test_that()`:

```{r}
test_that(
  scenario(
        title = "Example of thing",
        given = "My package is installed and loaded",
        when = "I do something",
        then = "the right thing happens"
      ),
  code = {
    expect_true(TRUE)
  }
)
```
